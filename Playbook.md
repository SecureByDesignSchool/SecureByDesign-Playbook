We will go through each of these in more detail below, but essentially that's the playbook to follow. 

We have broken down the big problem of "Cyber Security Risk Assessment" into smaller component problems that you can focus on and then assemble into the security picture, but bear in mind that each component cannot be done well in *complete* isolation so be aware of the bigger picture as you work.

To help this we strongly recommend going through it once - **quickly** and scrappily - to learn, and then again more carefully and **smartly** to be more thorough, and then again more **deeply** until it becomes routine and mostly automatic. 

## Overall

* Prepare!
* Assess the situation; identify:
  * The **assets** that we will protect, how they are used, and what the impact would be if they were affected
  * The 'space', or the **networks**, that the assets are stored in and the routes they move around on
  * The **adversaries** that are interested in attacking our assets and the **threats** they pose 
* Put these together to see where these threats might access which assets through what parts of the network - our **security picture**, including what **courses of action** attackers might take to affect our assets. 
* Work out what **areas** need **better defences**, and in what ways so you don't accidentally shoot yourselves in the foot.
* **Compare** the costs and benefits of the options, and **select suitable** ones to add. 

Once these new defences are included, or planned, then re-assess the situation, and continue on more deeply and thoroughly as you go.

'Scope' what you are examining: what are you responsible for, and what are you not? Start small and grow.  Be ready to record and track what you are finding out; we provide some starter material.

### Assets & Uses

<img style="float: right; width: 20%" src="./Assets.png"/>**Identify** your **assets** (devices, people, information, reputation, etc)  and what they are **used** for.  What **impact** would it have on you if they were stolen (nicked), disabled or broken (bricked) or corrupted (tricked)?  

[Quick-Start Asset Register](quick/Assets.md) - [Smart Assets](smart/Assets.md)  - [Deep Dive into Assets](deep/Assets.md)

### Cyber Space, Networks and Access

Where are your assets **located**? How do they **move** from stores to where they get used?  How and where does information **interact with people****?  What existing **defences** are in place, and where?

[Quick-Start Cyber Space](quick/Networks.md)  - [Smart Network Mapping](smart/Networks.md) - [Deep Monitoring](deep/Networks.md) 

### <img src="Threats.png" style="float:right; width:15%"/>Threats

Who are the **active adversaries** - the people and groups - that might attempt to nick, brick or trick your assets?  How good are they, and how likely are they to attack?

[Quick-Start Threats Guide](quick/Threats.md) - [Threat Assessment](smart/Threats.md) - [Threat Profiling](deep/Threats.md)

### Security Picture

Let's now put these together to see how *these* threats might navigate *this* network to affect *these* assets.  What defences are already in place?

[Quick-Start Security Picture](quick/SecurityPicture.md) - [Assessing the Situation](smart/SecurityPicture.md) - [Understanding the Security Picture](deep/SecurityPicture.md)  

### <img src="Defences.png" style="float:right; width:10%"/>Defence Options

What can you do to prevent attackers from accessing your systems? How can you monitor to see if any get in? What  responses should you prepare?

[Quick-Start Defences](quick/Defences.md) - [Defence Options](smart/Defences.md) - [Understanding Defence](deep/Defences.md)  

### <img src="AssessRisks.png" style="float:right; width:15%"/>Assess the Risks

What are the risks right now? What is the Risk Appetite - how much impact can you put up with? What are the options for defence? how do those costs weigh against the risks?

[Quick-Start Risks](quick/AssessRisks.md) - [Formal Risk Assessments](smart/AssessRisks.md) - [Understanding Risk](deep/AssessRisks.md)

### <img src="ActionPlan.png" style="float:right; width:15%"/>Action Plan

We use the Risk Registry from the Risk Assessment to prioritise the **defences** for those places that have the assets that are particularly vulnerable to the relevant threats, and that have high impacts if affected. 

[Quick-Start Action Plan](quick/ActionPlan.md) - [Formal Controls](smart/ActionPlan.md) - [Security Activities](deep/ActionPlan.md)

#### ... and ... again!

Plan out your next run through the playbook, this time focussing perhaps more on the areas that look vulnerable to attack that can cause you harm. 

Once these are implemented and tested, we can recalculate the risks until we are satisfied that the risks are acceptable.
